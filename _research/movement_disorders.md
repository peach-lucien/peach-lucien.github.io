The term "movement disorders" refers to a group of nervous system (neurological) conditions that cause abnormal increased movements, which may be voluntary or involuntary. Movement disorders can also cause reduced or slow movements.

I began my research into movement disorders in 2018-2019 with a collaboration between the [CMPH](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics-precision-healthcare) and the [Grossman Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/interventional-systems-neuroscience/) with a focus on Essential Tremor. Since then I have joined the [UniKlinik in Wuerzburg](https://www.ukw.de/neurologie/startseite/) and work with movement disorder data more generally, including Dystonia, Parkinson's and Essential Tremor.



## Suppresion of Essential Tremor

Our first paper reported a new method to track the phase of neural oscillations in real-time via endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) that mitigates the characteristic Gibbs distortion. We then used ecHT to show that the aberrant neural oscillation that hallmarks essential tremor (ET) syndrome, the most common adult movement disorder, can be transiently suppressed via transcranial electrical stimulation of the cerebellum phase-locked to the tremor. The tremor suppression is sustained shortly after the end of the stimulation and can be phenomenologically predicted. Finally, we use feature-based statistical-learning and neurophysiological-modelling to show that the suppression of ET is mechanistically attributed to a disruption of the temporal coherence of the aberrant oscillations in the olivocerebellar loop, thus establishing its causal role. 

We believe the suppression of aberrant neural oscillation via phase-locked driven disruption of temporal coherence may in the future represent a powerful neuromodulatory strategy to treat brain disorders. We are continuing to pursue this research from various angles - both in terms of stimulation and in terms of mapping the space of tremors for unsupervised learning.
