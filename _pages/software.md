I try to produce code for each paper so that others (like yourself maybe!) can easily implement our methods. The majority of the software packages that I have made open source are available in the [Barahona Group Github](https://github.com/barahona-research-group) or on [my own local github](https://github.com/peach-lucien). Below I have included links to specific projects!


## HCGA

I am the main developer of [highly comparative graph analysis (hcga)](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/hcga) a Python toolbox. It performs a massive feature extraction from a set of graphs, and applies supervised classification methods.

To install the latest release from PyPi:

```
pip install hcga
```


## Multiscale Centrality

I am a co-developer of the [`Multiscale Centrality`](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/MultiscaleCentrality) Python package for identifying nodes in networks that are central at different scales. You can view the [Physical Review Research](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033104) article for the package [here](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033104).
