I try to produce code for each paper so that others (like yourself maybe!) can easily implement our methods. The majority of the software packages that I have made open source are available in the [Barahona Group Github](https://github.com/barahona-research-group) or on [my own local github](https://github.com/peach-lucien). Below I have included links to specific projects!


## HCGA

I am the main developer of [highly comparative graph analysis (hcga)](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/hcga) a Python toolbox. It performs a massive feature extraction from a set of graphs, and applies supervised classification methods.

To install the latest release from PyPi:

```
pip install hcga
```


## PyGenStability

I am a co-developer of the [Python wrapper for Markov Stability](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/PyGenStability). The code wraps the [generalised Louvain code of Michael Schaub](https://github.com/michaelschaub/generalizedLouvain) with python code to run various versions of Markov Stability. See the [github](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/PyGenStability) for installation instructions and also see the [documentation](https://barahona-research-group.github.io/PyGenStability/).

## Multiscale Centrality

I am a co-developer of the [`Multiscale Centrality`](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/MultiscaleCentrality) Python package for identifying nodes in networks that are central at different scales. You can view the [Physical Review Research](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033104) article for the package [here](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033104).

## Graph Diffusion Reclassification

I am the main developer of [GDR](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/GDR), a Python package for node classification using diffusion of node labels. The original paper that accompanies the code can be found at [AIMS](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/fods.2020002).
